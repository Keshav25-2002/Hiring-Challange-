Conclusion: 

XGboost algorithms perform very well with an accuracy of 94%.

Further Improvements: 

In order to make it a better application, we can apply the following ideas: 

    1. We can create a backend application using Flask/Django and deploy it on the cloud. 

    2. For Those who have not got selected, we can create a database using SQL and we can store their resumes/information in the database. So when the role appears to match their profile, then we can retrieve and call them for interviews.
